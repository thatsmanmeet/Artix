# Artix
Artix is a simple web scrapper GUI built using tkinter and uses python to load the articles from the web.

## Technologies Used 🛠️

- Tkinter -> A Python Package used for building GUIs.
- Customtkinter -> A custom version of tkinter used for building beautiful GUIs.
- Requests -> A Python Package used for sending HTTP requests.
- BeautifulSoup -> A Python Library used for web scraping by parsing the HTML or XML documents.

## How it works ?

- Firstly the request package is used to make HTTP requests with the website and it returns the HTML Document.
- BeautifulSoup takes that HTML document and parses it using an HTML parses.
- BeautifulSoup is used to find the relevant tags that are used by the websites to host the content e.g Header Tags, Paragraph Tags etc
- Finally the parsed text is then displayed in the customtkinter's article box for a viewer to view.

## How to use it ?

1. Install Requests, BeautifulSoup, TKinter and customtkinter on your device by running command `pip install requests bs4 tkinter customtkinter` or `python3 -m pip install requests bs4 tkinter customtkinter`. You must have python installed. If not visit [Python.org's website](https://python.org).
2. Simply open an IDE or terminal and run the file by using the command `python Artix.py` or `python3 Artix.py`.
3. Enjoy!

## CLI Version

I have also created an CLI version of this which doesn't have any GUI. You can find that by [clicking here](https://github.com/thatsmanmeet/Python-Codes/blob/main/programs/articlescraper.py).
